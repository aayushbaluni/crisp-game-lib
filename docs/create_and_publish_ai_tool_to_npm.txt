## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed and configured on your system:

- **Node.js and npm:** [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (npm is included with Node.js).
- **Git:** [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- **npm Account:** [Sign up for an npm account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) if you don't have one already.

## Project Setup

### 1. Initialize the Project

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/ayushbaluni/WebstormProjects/crisp-game-lib
   ```

2. **Initialize npm:**

   Initialize a new npm project by running:

   ```bash
   npm init
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set up your `package.json` file. You can accept the default settings or customize them as needed. Ensure that the `name` field is unique within the npm registry.

### 2. Set Up Project Structure

1. **Create Necessary Directories:**

   Ensure that your project has the following essential directories:

   - `src/`: Contains the source code.
   - `docs/`: Contains documentation files.
   - `assets/`: (Optional) Contains static assets like images or fonts.
   - `configs/`: (Optional) Contains configuration files.

2. **Add AI Game Creation Files:**

   Place the previously created AI prompts and guides into the appropriate directories within `docs/`:

   - `docs/ai_game_creation_guide.txt`
   - `docs/ai_game_creation_prompt.txt`
   - `docs/character_creation_plan.txt`
   - `docs/create_and_publish_ai_tool_to_npm.txt`

## Implementing the AI Game Creation Tool

### 1. Develop Core Functionality

Within the `src/` directory, create the necessary TypeScript or JavaScript files that implement the AI game creation logic.

#### Example Implementation:

```typescript
// src/index.ts
import { AIProcessor } from './aiProcessor';

const aiProcessor = new AIProcessor();

// Example usage
const userInput = `I am developing a game titled "Adventure Quest." It is a thrilling adventure game...`;
aiProcessor.generateGame(userInput);
```

```typescript
// src/aiProcessor.ts
export class AIProcessor {
  generateGame(description: string) {
    // Logic to parse the description and generate game structure
    // This could involve natural language processing, template generation, etc.
    console.log("Generating game based on description:", description);
    // Implement the AI logic here
  }
}
```

### 2. Integrate AI Capabilities

Depending on the complexity of your AI requirements, you might integrate machine learning models or leverage existing AI services.

- **Using OpenAI API:**

  Install necessary packages:

  ```bash
  npm install openai
  ```

  Implement API integration:

  ```typescript
  // src/aiProcessor.ts
  import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai';

  export class AIProcessor {
    private openai: OpenAIApi;

    constructor() {
      const configuration = new Configuration({
        apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
      });
      this.openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
    }

    async generateGame(description: string) {
      try {
        const response = await this.openai.createCompletion({
          model: "text-davinci-003",
          prompt: `Create a game structure based on the following description:\n\n${description}`,
          max_tokens: 1500,
        });
        console.log("Generated Game Structure:", response.data.choices[0].text);
        // Further processing to create game files
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error generating game:", error);
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  **Note:** Ensure that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is securely stored and not exposed in your codebase.

## Version Control with Git

### 1. Initialize Git Repository

```bash
git init
```

### 2. Add Files and Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of AI Game Creation Tool"
```

### 3. Connect to Remote Repository (Optional)

If you have a remote repository (e.g., GitHub), add it:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/crisp-game-lib.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Configuring TypeScript

### 1. Initialize TypeScript Configuration

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

### 2. Customize `tsconfig.json`

Ensure that the configuration aligns with your project's needs. For example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

## Adding Scripts to `package.json`

Update your `package.json` to include scripts for building and running the project:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "prepare": "npm run build"
  }
}
```
