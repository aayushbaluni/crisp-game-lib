# Setup and Publish AI Game Creation Tool to npm

## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step process for setting up the AI Game Creation Tool and publishing it to the npm repository. By following these instructions, you will be able to prepare your project for distribution, ensuring that it is well-configured and accessible to users via npm.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed and configured on your system:

- **Node.js and npm:** [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (npm is included with Node.js).
- **Git:** [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- **npm Account:** [Sign up for an npm account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) if you don't have one already.

## Steps to Create and Publish the AI Game Creation Tool

### 1. Initialize the Project

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/ayushbaluni/WebstormProjects/crisp-game-lib
   ```

2. **Initialize npm:**

   Initialize a new npm project by running:

   ```bash
   npm init
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set up your `package.json` file. You can accept the default settings or customize them as needed. Ensure that the `name` field is unique within the npm registry.

### 2. Set Up Project Structure

1. **Create Necessary Directories:**

   Ensure that your project has the following essential directories:

   - `src/`: Contains the source code.
   - `docs/`: Contains documentation files.
   - `assets/`: (Optional) Contains static assets like images or fonts.
   - `configs/`: (Optional) Contains configuration files.

2. **Add AI Game Creation Files:**

   Place the previously created AI prompts and guides into the appropriate directories within `docs/`:

   - `docs/ai_game_creation_guide.txt`
   - `docs/ai_game_creation_prompt.txt`
   - `docs/character_creation_plan.txt`

### 3. Implement the AI Game Creation Tool

1. **Develop Core Functionality:**

   Within the `src/` directory, create the necessary TypeScript or JavaScript files that implement the AI game creation logic. For example:

   - `src/index.ts`: Entry point of the application.
   - `src/aiProcessor.ts`: Handles AI input processing and game generation.

2. **Example Implementation:**

   ```typescript
   // src/index.ts
   import { AIProcessor } from './aiProcessor';

   const aiProcessor = new AIProcessor();

   // Example usage
   const userInput = `I am developing a game titled "Adventure Quest." It is a thrilling adventure game...`;
   aiProcessor.generateGame(userInput);
   ```

   ```typescript
   // src/aiProcessor.ts
   export class AIProcessor {
     generateGame(description: string) {
       // Logic to parse the description and generate game structure
     }
   }
   ```

### 4. Configure TypeScript (If Using TypeScript)

1. **Initialize TypeScript Configuration:**

   ```bash
   npx tsc --init
   ```

2. **Customize `tsconfig.json`:**

   Ensure that the configuration aligns with your project's needs. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "ES6",
       "module": "commonjs",
       "outDir": "./dist",
       "rootDir": "./src",
       "strict": true,
       "esModuleInterop": true
     },
     "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
   }
   ```

### 5. Add Scripts to `package.json`

Update your `package.json` to include scripts for building and running the project:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "prepare": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

### 6. Version Control with Git

1. **Initialize Git Repository:**

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add Files and Commit:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of AI Game Creation Tool"
   ```

3. **Connect to Remote Repository (Optional):**

   If you have a remote repository (e.g., GitHub), add it:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/crisp-game-lib.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

### 7. Publish to npm

1. **Log in to npm:**

   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

   Enter your npm credentials when prompted.

2. **Verify `package.json`:**

   Ensure that all necessary fields in `package.json` are correctly filled, especially:

   - `name`: Unique package name.
   - `version`: Start with `1.0.0` or appropriate initial version.
   - `main`: Entry point file, e.g., `dist/index.js`.
   - `files`: Specify files to include, e.g., `["dist/", "docs/"]`.
   - `keywords`: Relevant keywords for your package.
   - `author` and `license`: Your information and chosen license.

3. **Build the Project:**

   Compile the TypeScript files (if applicable):

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Publish the Package:**

   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```

   _Note:_ If you encounter an error about the package name already being taken, choose a different, unique name in your `package.json`.

### 8. Post-Publish Steps

1. **Tagging the Release:**

   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Update Documentation:**

   Ensure that all documentation in the `docs/` directory is up-to-date and provides clear instructions for users.

3. **Maintain the Package:**

   - **Updates:** When making changes, increment the version number following semantic versioning (`major.minor.patch`).
   - **Bug Fixes:** Address any issues reported by users.
   - **Improvements:** Continuously enhance the tool based on feedback and evolving requirements.

### 9. Additional Considerations

- **Testing:**
  Implement automated tests to ensure the reliability of your AI game creation tool.

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest
  ```

  Configure Jest in your `package.json` or create a `jest.config.js` file.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  Set up CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployment processes.

- **Licensing:**
  Choose an appropriate license for your project and include a `LICENSE` file in your repository.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you will successfully set up the AI Game Creation Tool and publish it to the npm repository, making it accessible to a wider audience. Regular maintenance and updates will ensure that your tool remains functional, reliable, and aligned with user needs.
